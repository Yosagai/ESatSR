# ESatSR

An implementation of "ESatSR: Enhancing Super-resolution for Satellite Remote Sensing Images with State Space Model and Spatial Context"

# Requirements

To run our code, you will need:

- Ubuntu 20.04
- CUDA 11.7
- Python 3.8
- Pytorch
- mambassm
- casual_conv1d
- Multiscale Deformable Attention

# <a name="todo"></a> TODO

- [x] Build repository
- [ ] Release model
- [ ] Release configs
- [ ] Pretrained weights
- [ ] Add code for complexity analysis
- [ ] Exploring lightweight version
- [ ] More tasks

The authors are now dedicating their efforts towards preparing for graduation. We will begin to organize and release our codes in the future once the time permits.

# Acknowledgement

The codes are based on [SwinIR], [VMamba], [BasicSR]. Thanks for their great works.
